This repository contains a COBOL program demonstrating a common off-by-one error when working with arrays. The `bug.cob` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version. The error arises from incorrect loop boundary handling when accessing array elements.  The corrected version ensures proper loop termination to avoid out-of-bounds access.
